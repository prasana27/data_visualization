# Coding Gym 1 : Functions

## Induction

These exercises are designed to help you build confidence programming with Elm. They assume no prior experience of coding in any language and comprise simple tasks that build your familiarity with the process of coding. In many cases they involve repetitions of limited coding tasks, but just like repeats in a gym, the more you do, the easier it gets.

The exercises will not focus on visualization (for that, see the main lecture notes), but instead concentrate on basic principles of coding in a functional language.

If you are viewing this document in Atom with litvis you can simply add your own code blocks to this document.

If not, open up the Atom editor, create a new blank file (`File->New File` or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd-N`) and immediately save it as `gymExercises.md` in your `session01` folder. Make sure you have the litvis preview window open (`Packages->Markdown Preview Enhanced with litvis->Toggle` or the keyboard shortcut `Shift-Ctrl-M`). You editor should now look similar to this:

## Limbering Up: Placing Elm code blocks in a litvis document

- Create an empty Elm _code block_ in your document by using a pair of triple backticks as follows:

````
```elm {l raw}

```
````

The `l` in the code block header means display the literate code in the preview window. `raw` means that the value of any functions you create in the block will be displayed in the preview.

## 1.1. Simple functions

Our first coding exercises will create some functions to return values of some kind. You can give a function any name you like as long as it starts with a lowercase letter and has no spaces. The first line of a function definition is its _type signature_ and reports the type of value it will generate. In the examples below, `myName` generates a `String` (some text), `myYearOfBirth` an integer (whole number) and `myFavouriteNumber` a floating point number (a number with a decimal point).

Below the type signature you name the function again followed by `=` and then on a new line indented should be the code that does the work of generating a value to return.

```elm {l siding}
myName : String
myName =
    "Ada Lovelace"


myYearOfBirth : Int
myYearOfBirth =
    1815


myFavouriteNumber : Float
myFavouriteNumber =
    2.71828
```

{(task|}

Create separate functions that display the following, each in their own `raw` code block. If created successfully, you should see the result of each function appear in the preview window.

- Your own first name.
- Your own last name.
- Your own year of birth.
- The number [Ï€](https://www.piday.org/million/) rounded to six decimal places (you can just provide the number to 6 d.p. rather than relying on any _round_ function).
- A quote of your choice about data visualization.
- The number of legs of a titmouse.

## 1.2. Simple functions with operators

As well as assigning numbers or strings directly to a function, you can also get the code to perform calculations with _operators_. For example, to add two numbers together you might have a function:

```elm {l siding}
daysWorking : Int
daysWorking =
    5 + 6
```

Other operators you might use include `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `//` (integer division), `/` (floating point division), `^` (exponentiation, such as `4^2` for four-squared) and `++` for concatenating (joining) strings. These operators can be applied directly to numbers (or strings) or to functions that generate numbers (or strings). If you need to control the order in which operators apply, you can use brackets. For example `2 * (3 + 4)` is 14, not 10.

{(task|}

Try these exercises by creating functions to calculate:

- The sum of the integers 1 to 5.
- 22 divided by 7 to at least 12 decimal places.
- The number of seconds in a leap-year.
- Your _James Bond name_ (i.e. in the form "Bond, James Bond").
- The mean (average) of the numbers 1 to 5.
